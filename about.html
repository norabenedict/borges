<p>Much of the raw data that drives this project, from the descriptive bibliography to the GIS mapping itself, would not have been possible without the holdings in the Borges Collection housed in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia. From first editions every other crucial volume of prose, poetry, and essays from Borges's life during this period to a muyriad of manuscripts, newspaper clippings, translated editions, and edited collections, this collection truly allows scholars to trace the praxis of writing and production of knowledge in this Argentine writer's works. </p>

<p>Nora Benedict is a Ph.D. candidate in Spanish at the University of Virginia. Her current research focuses on twentieth-century Latin American literature, descriptive bibliography, the intersection of digital and print culture, and the question of interpretation as influenced by textual materiality. Her dissertation, “The Fashioning of Jorge Luis Borges: Magazines, Books, and Print Culture in Argentina, 1930-1951,” focuses on the marked presence of books (and book production) in this Argentine writer’s life by examining the physical features of his works, which she reads through the lens of analytical bibliography and material studies.</p>
