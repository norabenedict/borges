  <p>Before becoming a beacon of Spanish-language publishing in the early twentieth century, Buenos Aires was known for its huge smattering of bookstores and, to this day, still maintains that fame. Interestingly, what we find in the scant descriptions of these bookstores is their high level of specialization. Thus, for instance, Joge Luis Borges’s passion for English literature, undoubtedly a result of the influence of his English grandmother on his formative years, led him (frequently) to bookstores such as Mackern’s (Sarmiento 525) and Mitchell’s Book Store (Cangallo 580), both of which specialized in imported foreign literature (mainly English). Alongside these two regularly visited shops, several of Borges’s personal books from the Biblioteca Nacional also contain tags from a number of other bookstores including Pymalion, Goethe, Beutelspacher, and Viau y Cía, all of which contain inventory ranging from books produced by British and German publishing firms to luxury books, or art books, of fine quality paper and exquisite bindings.</p>
  <p>The central aim of my dissertation is a materially informed look into Borges’s process of publication in the early part of his literary career (1930-1951): who were his primary publishers? What types of editorial jobs did he hold? Which works were independently printed and which did others fund? What can we tell about his development of aesthetics based on analysis of typography and paper choices? By asking these types of questions about Borges’s preferences toward the publication of his own works, we also find that he had a very specific taste for the look and feel of others’ books and, in one of his early works from this period, makes a snide, and extremely revealing, remark about second-hand bookstores as nothing more than “turgid purgatories.” In light of the fact that the place in which a book is published, printed, and even purchased are all key characteristic of that specific volume, I was interested in creating a digital project that allowed me to think deeply about the spatial (and temporal) evolution of the process of publication (and, in turn, the circulation of published works) in Jorge Luis Borges’s Argentina (1930-1951). I see my project as the perfect intersection of literature, publishing history, and economics, all of which have played a crucial role in my dissertation thus far. </p>

  <p>Nora Benedict is a Ph.D. candidate in Spanish at the University of Virginia. Her current research focuses on twentieth-century Latin American literature, descriptive bibliography, the intersection of digital and print culture, and the question of interpretation as influenced by textual materiality. Her dissertation, “The Fashioning of Jorge Luis Borges: Magazines, Books, and Print Culture in Argentina, 1930-1951,” focuses on the marked presence of books (and book production) in this Argentine writer’s life by examining the physical features of his works, which she reads through the lens of analytical bibliography and material studies.</p>
