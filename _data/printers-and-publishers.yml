editorial-tor:
  name: Editorial Tor
  type: publisher
  history: "Founded on June 16, 1916 by the exiled Spaniard Juan Carlos Torrendell. During the first years of Editorial TOR’s existence, the publishing house was somewhat indistinguishable from other firms throughout Buenos Aires since its focus was on Spanish literature and “best sellers.” With the purchase of its first rotary press in 1930, TOR soon became synonymous with cheap paperbacks, usually of extremely poor quality."

emecé-editores:
  name: "Emecé Editores"
  type: publisher
  history: "Founded in 1939 by Mariano Medina del Río, Álvaro de las Casas, and Carlos Braun Menéndez. The specific name of the publishing house was a combination of their names. In light of the Galician roots of the founding memebers, the first works published by Emecé were related to Galician culture, which was not commercially successful. Following this first flop, the directors of Emecé switched gears to focus on more canonical Spanish works and eventually incorporated more Latin American works as well."

los-talleres-gráficos-el-colón:
  name: "Los talleres gráficos el 'Colón'"
  type: printer
  history: "A native of Buenos Aires, Francisco A. Colombo (1878—1953) was most known for his typographical artistry.Even though he was self-taught in the field of book production and had no professional training, the books that he printed over the years can be considered nothing short of works of art. At the beginning of the twentieth century in Argentina, luxury editions were rare and thus, the work of Colombo was all the more notable.In terms of the specifics of his printing and typographical style, Francisco A. Colombo is known for instituting the following standards: a cover with centered, upper-case typography (normally Garamond or Bodoni) printed on white or neutral paper, a title page with the same typeface with information about the publishing house and/or printer centered at the bottom of the page, typography of the text throughout in Garamond (size 10 or 12), and a justified colophon on the last page with hand-written numbering (Marqués 21)."

  history: "Born in Russia at the close of the nineteenth century, Manuel Gleizer arrived in Entre Ríos, Argentina with his parents around 1901 and would remain there, working the land, until 1918 when he moved to Buenos Aires. In this larger metropolis he started a business selling lottery tickets but soon realized that the odds were stacked against him and, as a result, turned to selling books to eliminate his debt.After this accidental encounter with book markets, Gleizer opened his own bookstore, Librería La Cultura, which soon evolved into a common hangout for young intellectuals. Not long after, in 1922 to be exact, Gleizer turned to the publishing profession."

editorial-oportet-&-haereses:

  type: publisher
  history: "This firm is what I would deem apocryphal for the sheer fact that it emerged out of thin air and cannot trace its roots to any magazine or journal, like the Editorial Destiempo can. What is more, the only works published by this firm are those of its two founders, Borges and Bioy Casares. For these reasons, the works produced by the Editorial Oportet & Haereses are not very different from earlier works that Borges and Bioy Casares sent straight to a printer to be self-published without the name of a specific firm adorning their covers. Here, we only see the addition of an invented publisher’s name, perhaps to give these works a greater sense of authority for having passed through the hands of an unbiased editor."

  history: "This somewhat apocryphal publishing firm was founded by Borges and Bioy Casares in 1937, and it emerged from their collaborative literary journal of the same name (_Destiempo_). The Editorial Destiempo highlights the efforts of these two writers, who continuously promoted underrepresented intellectual voices in literature that deserve to be part of the larger Argentine canon. What is more, the subtle nuances of political and social critique that permeate both of Bioy Casares’s books emphasize the fact that these Editorial Destiempo works were not intended for the average (Argentine) reader, but rather signal a more elite and well-educated individual."
