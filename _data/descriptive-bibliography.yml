    paper: "Wove. A great deal of yellow spotting due to age. No chain or wire lines are visible on the pages. Very think paper, akin to a construction paper. The pages are cut to a uniform size, but some of the edges are slightly jagged."
    typography: ""
    colophon: "'Este libro terminóse de imprimir el 30 de Setiembre de mil novecientos treinta en los talleres gráficos “Colón”, de Francisco A. Colombo, San Antonio de Areco, Sucursal: Hortiguera 552 Bs. As. para la Editorial M. Gleizer' ([125])"
    binding: "Light pink, soft-cover book. Since the cover of this copy is detached, it is easier to tell that this thicker piece of cardboard-like paper (with a very smooth (almost glossy) finish) was simply glued on to the book block. The cover has black lettering: 'JORGE LUIS BORGES EVARISTO CARRIEGO M. GLEIZER EDITOR TRIUNVIRATO 537 BUENOS AIRES 1930'. The printing on the spine reads: 'JORGE LUIS BORGES EVARISTO CARRIEGO M. GLEIZER EDITOR 1930'. The back cover as the insigna of M. Gleizer, the profile of a face that much resembles Erasmus along with the phrase “M. Gleizer” spelled out vertically alongside the face. In the bottom, right-hand corner of the back cover is the price of the volume, which has been obscured by a previous sticker (adhered and then peeled off at one point). No protective tissue-paper layer protects the covers. The pages in this copy lay flat and it is much easier to see the stitching at the center of each gathering (one single stitch loop)."

Jaurés (antes Bermejo) al 1000.' & 'Esquina en las'"
